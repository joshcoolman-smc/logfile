Two stories landed this week that, taken together, paint a pretty vivid picture of where software is headed. One wiped $300 billion off the market in five days. The other came from a Spotify earnings call where the co-CEO casually mentioned that his best engineers haven't written a line of code since December.

## The SaaSpocalypse

On January 30th, Anthropic released eleven open-source agentic plugins for Claude Cowork — tools that let an AI agent pull data from CRMs, draft legal documents, analyze spreadsheets, and manage project boards. Not developer tools. Business tools. The kind of workflows that Salesforce, Atlassian, and Thomson Reuters charge per-seat licenses for.

Wall Street's response was immediate and violent. Jeffrey Favuzza at Jefferies coined the term: the **SaaSpocalypse**. An apocalypse for software-as-a-service stocks.

Atlassian dropped 35% in a single week. Salesforce fell 26% to a 52-week low. Thomson Reuters had its worst single-day decline on record. Monday.com lost over 20%. The S&P North American software index plunged 15% in January alone — its worst month since 2008.

The math behind the panic is simple: why pay for ten software licenses when one AI agent handles the workflow?

The traditional SaaS model charges per seat, per user. But if an AI agent can do the work of ten users, the per-seat model doesn't just need repricing — it breaks entirely. Analysts are calling it the end of the "easy-growth era" for cloud subscriptions and a shift toward outcome-based pricing, where companies pay for completed tasks rather than software access.

JPMorgan put out a note saying the sector was being "sentenced before trial." Some analysts argue the selloff is analytically lazy — that markets lumped Thomson Reuters, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and LegalZoom together as if they face identical threats when they clearly don't. Companies sitting on proprietary data moats are in a fundamentally different position than commodity workflow tools.

But the broader signal is hard to dismiss. The IPO window for software companies has effectively shut. M&A activity is paralyzed. Venture funding for mid-stage SaaS startups has dried up. As one analyst put it: "Code alone was never a real moat."

## Spotify's Engineers Stopped Writing Code

Then on February 10th, Spotify co-CEO Gustav Söderström said something on their Q4 earnings call that sent its own kind of ripple through the industry.

> "When I speak to my most senior engineers, the best developers we had, they actually say that they haven't written a single line of code since December. They actually only generate code and supervise it."

Spotify built an internal tool called **Honk**, powered by Claude, that lets engineers manage code from their phones. Söderström described how an engineer on their morning commute can tell Claude to fix a bug or add a feature to the iOS app via Slack. Claude does the work, pushes a new build back to Slack, and the engineer reviews and merges it — all before arriving at the office.

The numbers back up the claim. Spotify shipped over 50 new features in 2025. Their R&D expenses dropped 23% year-over-year. Operating income grew over 50%. Engineers aren't writing less code — they're producing more while spending less. Söderström said engineering capacity is "no longer the limiting factor; consumer comfort with change is."

That's a remarkable statement. The bottleneck at a major tech company is no longer how fast they can build things. It's how fast users can absorb change.

## What Both Stories Are Really About

The SaaSpocalypse and Spotify's coding shift are the same story from different angles.

The SaaSpocalypse is about what happens to **products** when AI agents can replicate their functionality. If a general-purpose agent can manage a project board, draft a contract, and update a CRM, then the specialized tools that do those things individually need a reason to exist beyond "we were here first."

Spotify's story is about what happens to **roles**. Their engineers didn't get replaced — they got promoted. They went from writing code to supervising systems that write code. The job became architecture, judgment, and review rather than syntax and implementation.

But here's what both stories share: the assumption that the middle layer — the commodity work, whether it's a SaaS product or a line of code — is being compressed toward zero. What survives is what sits above or below that layer. Proprietary data. Domain expertise. Judgment about what to build and why.

The SaaSpocalypse might be an overreaction in the short term. Spotify's story might not generalize to every engineering org. But the direction is clear. The value of software is migrating away from the code itself and toward the decisions that shape it.

The question isn't whether AI changes how we build software. It's whether the people and companies in the middle of that shift recognize what's happening fast enough to adapt.
